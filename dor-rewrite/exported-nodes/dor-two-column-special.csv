  <p>Monthly and Quarterly taxpayers must file and pay their taxes  electronically. (<a href=""http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=82.32.080"" target=""_blank"">Revised Code of Washington 82.32.080</a>). </p>
  <p> Monthly taxpayers have been required to file and pay  electronically since Substitute Senate Bill 5571 was passed by the 2009  Legislature. Quarterly  taxpayers have been required to file and pay electronically since Engrossed House Bill 1357 was passed by the  2011 Legislature.</p>
  Taxpayers who are unable to file and pay  electronically may
  <a href=""#Waiver"">request  a waiver</a>. 
  <h3><strong>How do I file my taxes electronically?</strong> </h3>
  <p>File your return electronically using E-file, the  Department’s online filing tool. To use E-file, you must <a href=""https://fortress.wa.gov/dor/efile/FortressLogon/"">create an online account</a>.  You will need your <a href=""/content/home/popups/ubi.htm"" target=""_blank"">Tax Registration/UBI Number</a> and <a href=""/content/fileandpaytaxes/fileoramendmyreturn/paclocations.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Pre-Assigned Access Code (PAC)</a>. </p>
  <p> To see a preview of the registration process, click on <a href=""/Content/Home/help/ScreensMyAccountEfile.htm"">Preview of My Account and E-file</a>.</p>
  <p> Once you create your account, click on <em>File return</em> next to the period you wish to report. Follow the  prompts. For help in the E-file program, click on the <em>Tutorial</em> icon in the upper right of most pages.<br /></p>
  
  <h3><strong>Get electronic reminders</strong></h3>
  <p>You can sign up for electronic  due date reminders and sales tax rate changes during the registration process. Those  notices will go to the email address you enter when you create your account. </p>
  <p> If you already have an account and you are not receiving  electronic reminders, please log into your account at dor.wa.gov.  Select <em>E-mail & notices</em> on the left menu  and then, click on <em>E-mail notifications  (listserv)</em> and follow the prompts to join or leave the <em>Electronic Filing (E-file)</em> list.  </p>
  <h3><strong>How do I pay my taxes electronically?</strong> </h3>
  <p>Paying taxes electronically is the last step of the E-file  process. You will find your payment options in My Account, on the left under<em> Invoices & payment options</em>. </p>
  <p> Below is a description of each option:</p>
  <ul><li><strong>Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)<br /></strong>You must <a href=""https://fortress.wa.gov/dor/efile//MyAccount/Home/EFTRegistration.aspx/Start"">register to use EFT</a> by selecting <em>Electronic funds transfer registration/update</em>. </li>
    <ul><li><em><strong>EFT Debit</strong></em><em>: </em>You authorize the Department’s bank to  withdraw the amount you owe from your bank account on the date you select. This  happens automatically when you submit your return. </li>
      <li><em><strong>EFT Credit: </strong></em>You authorize your bank to send funds to the  Department’s account. You must initiate this payment each time you submit payment.</li>
    </ul><li><strong>E-check </strong><br />
      You enter your bank account number and routing information to make a one-time  payment. The transaction is free and only gives the Department permission to withdraw the amount that you authorize.</li>
    <li><strong>Credit Card</strong> <br />
      You enter your credit card information to make a one-time payment. You can use  Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover. A 2.5% fee is charged by a  non-state vendor for this service. </li>
    </ul><h3><strong>Benefits  of using E-File</strong> </h3>
  <p>Nearly a quarter million Washington  businesses have already discovered the benefits of using E-file. Whether you’re  a small business or a CPA who handles multiple accounts, E-file offers several  advantages over traditional paper filing. </p>
  <p>Benefits  of E-file include:</p>
  <ul><li>24/7 access to your tax return and payment system.</li>
    <li>Instantaneous delivery of your return with confirmation.</li>
    <li>Automatic error checking.</li>
    <li>Ability to customize your return to include only the classifications you  need.</li>
    <li>Four payment options: EFT Debit, EFT Credit, E-check, and credit card.</li>
    <li>Ability to import data from software programs.</li>
    <li>Faster processing and fewer errors.</li>
  </ul><h3><strong><a name=""Waiver"" id=""Waiver""></a>If you can’t file and  pay electronically</strong> </h3>
  You may request a waiver. Reasons why a waiver may be granted include:
  <ul><li>You do not have a computer. </li>
    <li>You do not have access to the internet using your own computer. </li>
    <li>You do not have a bank account or a credit card. </li>
    <li>Your bank is unable to send or receive electronic funds transfer  transactions. </li>
  </ul><p>To request a waiver, send a written request with explanation to:</p>

  <h2><strong>Examples of Destination-based Sales Tax</strong></h2>
  <ul type=""disc""><li>A resident of Olympia orders a pizza from a restaurant       located in Tumwater. The store delivers the pizza to the customer in Olympia. Sales tax is based on the       customer’s location in Olympia. </li>
  </ul><ul><li>A Darrington resident purchases a couch at a furniture store in  Bothell and requests that the merchant deliver the couch to the customer’s home  in Darrington.  Sales tax is based on the customer’s location in Darrington. </li>
  </ul><ul><li>A Vancouver resident purchases a computer  online from a merchant in Seattle. The computer is a gift for a  student attending college in Pullman. The buyer directs the seller  to ship the computer to the student’s address in Pullman. The sale is based on the  location of the student in Pullman. The merchant should collect  sales tax based on the “ship to” address in Pullman. </li>
  </ul><ul><li>A Spokane Valley resident purchases a mattress  at a store in Spokane. The merchant delivers the  mattress from its warehouse located in Deer Park to the customer’s home in Spokane Valley. Sales tax is based on the  customer’s location in Spokane Valley. </li>
  </ul><p> </p>
  <h4>What about deliveries to locations  outside of Washington?</h4>
  <p>There is no change for deliveries outside of Washington. Washington’s sales tax does not apply on  sales of goods when the seller delivers the goods to the buyer at a location  outside the state. <strong> </strong></p>
  <h4><br /><strong>Sales tax on short-term leases:</strong></h4>
  <p>Sales tax on leases<strong> </strong>that require recurring periodic  payments is generally based on the customer’s location, except the initial  payment. For leases (other than motor vehicles, trailers, semi-trailers, or aircraft)  that require recurring periodic payments, sales tax is sourced as follows:</p>
  <ul><li>If the buyer receives the property at the seller’s location,  sales tax on the first periodic payment is based on the seller’s location. Sales  tax on subsequent payments is based on the primary property location for each  period covered by the payment. The primary property location is considered to  be the address for the property that the buyer provides to the seller and that  the seller maintains in its records in the ordinary course of business, when  use of this address does not constitute bad faith.</li>
  </ul><ul><li>If the buyer does not receive the property at the seller’s  location, sales tax on the first periodic payment is based on the location  where receipt occurs, if known by the seller.   Sales tax on subsequent payments is based on the primary property  location for each period covered by the payment. </li>
  </ul><p><br /><strong>Sales tax on rentals:</strong></p>
  <ul><li>Olympia Construction Co. rents a “pressure washer” from Chehalis  Rental Co.  The rental period is one  week. Olympia Construction picks up the  equipment in Chehalis and delivers it to their job site in Yelm. Sales tax is  based on the seller’s location in Chehalis. </li>
  </ul><ul><li>If Chehalis Rental Co. delivers the pressure washer directly to  the job site in Yelm, sales tax would be based on the location of the job  site in Yelm. </li>
  </ul><ul><li>Washington’s tax does not apply if  Chehalis Rental Co. delivers the pressure washer to the customer at a location  outside the state of Washington. </li>
  </ul><ul type=""disc""><li>D&R Construction,       located in Olympia, rents a “backhoe” from       Construction Rentals, located in Tacoma. The rental period is 45       days, for a lump sum rental payment of $3,000. D&R picks up the       equipment in Tacoma and delivers it to a job       site in DuPont. Sales tax on the rental payment is based on the seller’s       location in Tacoma.</li>

     <p>Reseller permits allow:</p>
     <ul><li>Retailers and wholesalers to purchase <strong>items for resale</strong> in the regular course of their business without paying sales tax. </li>
       <li>Manufacturers to purchase, without paying sales tax, <strong>ingredients or components</strong> that enter into and become a physical part of a new article or substance produced for sale.</li>
     </ul><p><strong>Misuse of a reseller permit</strong> can result in substantial penalties for the buyer, including revocation of the permit.  The Department routinely examines purchases made with reseller permits  to verify permits are used appropriately. Anyone  found using a permit inappropriately:</p>
    <ul><li>Will owe the tax due and a 50 percent penalty—even if there was no  fraud intended.</li>
      <li>Could have their permit revoked.</li>
    </ul><h3>Responsibilities of businesses USING reseller permits</h3>
    <p>If your business has been issued a reseller permit you are responsible for ensuring that the permit is used properly. </p>
    <h4><strong>Proper Use of a reseller permit</strong></h4>
    <p>      Use your reseller permit to buy <strong>only</strong> those items that you <strong><u>directly resell</u></strong> in the regular  course of your business. </p>
    <p>For industry specific information on how to use reseller permits, please see our <a href=""/content/doingbusiness/businesstypes/industry/"" target=""_blank"">Industry Specific Guides</a>.</p>
    <h4><strong>Misuse of reseller  permits</strong></h4>
    <p> Businesses may not use a reseller permit to buy:  </p>
    <ul><li>Items for personal or household use.</li>
      <li>Items to be given away. </li>
      <li>Items used in the business, such as supplies and equipment.</li>
      <li>Items used by the business in performing the business activity  even if billed to customers. </li>
      <li>Tools or equipment, (unless you are in the business of directly  reselling or renting out such items)</li>
      <li>Equipment rentals</li>
    </ul><h4><strong>How  to get a reseller permit</strong></h4>
    <p>      The Department may automatically issue or renew  permits to qualifying businesses. </p>
    <p> If the Department has not automatically issued you  a permit and you buy goods to resell, you have the following options: </p>
    <ol><li>Pay sales tax on your purchases and then take a <a href=""/Content/FindTaxesAndRates/RetailSalesTax/ResellerPermit/TaxableAmount.aspx"">Taxable  Amount for Tax Paid at Source</a> deduction on your tax return  when you report the sale.</li>
      <li>Pay sales tax on your purchases and then request a  refund directly from the Department.</li>
      <li>Apply for a reseller permit: </li>
      </ol><ul><li><a href=""https://fortress.wa.gov/dor/efile/MyAccount/ResellersPermit/Default.aspx"">Apply  online</a>:
          <ul><li>Log in to My Account </li>
            <li>Choose “Manage  Account” in left navigation  bar </li>
            <li>Choose “Apply/View status of Reseller Permit” </li>
            <li>Follow the instructions </li>
          </ul></li>
      </ul><p>To be sure you receive your  reseller permit renewal, keep your <a href=""https://fortress.wa.gov/dor/efile/secureforms/content/doingbusiness/myaccount/updateubi.aspx"">business  contact information current</a>.</p>
    <p>          <strong><em>Note:</em></strong> If  your business is not <a href=""/content/doingbusiness/registermybusiness/"">required  to be registered</a> with the Department of Revenue and you purchase  goods for resale, you may qualify to use an alternative <a href=""/Content/FindTaxesAndRates/RetailSalesTax/ResellerPermit/ApprvdExemptCertifs.aspx"">approved  exemption certificate</a>. </p>
    <h4><strong>Print your reseller permit</strong></h4>
    <p> You can can view or print  your reseller permit by accessing it online through My Account.  </p>
    <ul><li>Log in to <a href=""https://fortress.wa.gov/dor/efile/MyAccount/ResellersPermit/Default.aspx"" target=""_blank"">My Account</a> </li>
      <li>Choose “Manage Account” in left  navigation bar </li>
      <li>Choose “Apply/View status of Reseller  Permit” </li>
      <li>Follow the  instructions </li>
    </ul><h4><strong>How long is a reseller permit valid?</strong><strong> </strong></h4>
    <p>Reseller  permits are generally valid for four years. However, permits are valid for only  two years if any of the following apply: </p>
    <ul><li>The business is a contractor;</li>
      <li>The business has been open for less than 12 months;</li>
      <li>The business has not reported gross income in the last 12 months;</li>
      <li>The business was on active non-reporting status at the time the  application was received;</li>
      <li>The business has failed to file tax returns any time during the  last 12 months.  </li>
    </ul><p><strong><em>Expiration notice:</em></strong> If your business’s  permit is not automatically renewed, you will receive a notice to apply for a  new reseller permit approximately 90 days before your permit expires.</p>
   

    <h3>Responsibilities of sellers that ACCEPT reseller permits</h3>
    <p>Every business that sells at wholesale must  have a valid reseller permit or other documentation for each customer that buys  without paying retail sales tax. </p>
    <h4>Verify that reseller permits are valid</h4>
    <p>You can use the Department’s online  tools to verify reseller permits:</p>
    <ul><li>For a  single record, use our <a href=""/content/doingbusiness/registermybusiness/brd/"">Business Records Database</a>. Keep a print copy of the record. </li>
      <li>For  multiple records, use our <a href=""https://fortress.wa.gov/dor/efile/secureforms/content/resellerpermitverification/"">Reseller Permit Verification Service</a>. If you choose to use this service, keep  the confirmation codes on your returned files. </li>
      <li>We  recommend verifying your customers’ reseller permit information at least once  per year.</li>
    </ul><h4><strong>Documenting wholesale sales</strong> </h4>
    <p>Sellers  must maintain proper documentation to support wholesale sales for five years  after the date of sale. Sellers have up to 120 days from the date of the sale  to collect the documentation. Documentation options include:</p>
    <ul><li>A paper  or electronic copy of the reseller permit. </li>
      <li>A print  out of the customer's information on our <a href=""/content/doingbusiness/registermybusiness/brd/"">Business Records Database</a>. </li>
      <li>The  confirmation codes received through the <a href=""https://fortress.wa.gov/dor/efile/secureforms/content/resellerpermitverification/"">Reseller Permit Verification Service</a>. </li>
    </ul><p>In the event of an audit, you will be asked  to provide documentation to support your wholesale sales. </p>
    <h4><strong>Other documents for tax-exempt  purchases</strong>              </h4>
    <p>Sellers  may accept other <a href=""/Content/FindTaxesAndRates/RetailSalesTax/ResellerPermit/ApprvdExemptCertifs.aspx"">approved exemption certificates</a> from  customers. To be valid, these certificates must be properly completed and  signed by the customer. </p>
    <h4><strong>When to collect sales tax</strong> </h4>
    <p>If the buyer does not have a valid  reseller permit or does not provide an approved exemption certificate, you need  to collect sales tax.</p>
    <p>Sellers  have the right to refuse to sell tax-exempt if they have reason to believe the  customer is misusing their reseller permit, is not reselling the items  purchased, or the permit is expired or otherwise not valid.</p>
    <p> Misuse of a reseller permit includes using a  reseller permit to purchase the following:  </p>
    <ul><li>Items for personal or household use.</li>
      <li>Items to be given away. </li>
      <li>Items for use in the business such as supplies and equipment.</li>
      <li>Tools or equipment, (unless the customer is in the business of  directly reselling such items)</li>
      <li>Equipment rentals </li>

  <h3>What is crowdfunding? </h3>
  <p>Crowdfunding is a way to raise money for a certain project.  This process usually takes place online and can reach a large group of people. Individuals  or small businesses can set financial goals for each project. Generally, the  fundraising goal must be met in order to collect any money. </p>
  <h3>Who participates in crowdfunding?</h3>
  
  <p>Crowdfunding participants include: </p>
  <ul><li><strong>Host</strong> – The host is usually a website or online platform. This site is where  individuals and companies can place and describe the project. The host receives  the donated money from <strong>backers</strong>. Once  the project meets its financial goal, the host keeps some of the money for  providing online services. Then, the rest of the money is given to the <strong>project creators</strong>. If the project  doesn’t meet its financial goal, some hosts require that the project creators  return the money to the backers. Other hosts give project creators whatever  money was raised.</li>
  </ul><ul><li><strong>Project  creator </strong>– The project creators are the people who create the  project. A project creator can be an individual or a business. The project  creator post the project ideas on the host website and asks backers for money. Project  creators set the goal, and a deadline. They may also provide the backers with rewards for funding the project.</li>
  </ul><ul><li><strong>Backer</strong> – A backer is a business or individual who offers money to project creators.  This group is usually made up of the general public, friends, family, etc. In  exchange for giving money to a project, backers can get rewards from the  project creators. These rewards can be anything from a thank you note to books,  dinners, tickets, or anything else. </li>
  </ul><p> </p>
  <h3>What’s an example of crowdfunding?</h3>
  <p>You are a book author. You want to turn one of your books  into a movie so you decide to use crowdfunding to raise money for your project.  You decide to reward your backers in the following ways:</p>
  <ul><li>Backer donates $1: You  write the backer a thank you note.</li>
    <li>Backer donates $5: You  write the backer a thank you note and list their name online as a supporter.</li>
    <li>Backer donates $25: You  give the backer a signed copy of your book.</li>
    <li>Backer donates $100: You  invite the backer to a private screening of your movie.</li>
    <li>Backer donates $250: You  invite the backer to a private screening of your movie, and to a cast dinner.</li>
    <li>Backer donates $500: You  invite the backer and two guests to a cast dinner and private screening of your  movie. Backer also gets a cameo appearance in the movie.</li>
    <li>Backer donates $1,000: You  buy the backer a plane ticket and movie tickets to see the movie opening in Los  Angeles, CA.</li>
  </ul><p> </p>
  <p>As the project creator, you are responsible to make sure  backers get their rewards. </p>
  <h3>When do state taxes apply to the donations received from crowd funding?</h3>
  
  <p>The project creator needs to report the donations in the reporting  period when the project is fully funded. For example, if the project is fully  funded in December 2014 and the project creator reports monthly, then you would  report the crowdfunding donations received to that point on your December 2014  excise tax return.</p>
  <h3>Do I have to collect and report sales tax when I use crowdfunding?</h3>
  
  <p>Yes, the project creator is required to collect sales tax on  donations if you provide <a href=""/Content/FindTaxesAndRates/RetailSalesTax/RetailServices.aspx"">retail  services</a> (such as meals), <a href=""/content/getaformorpublication/publicationbysubject/taxtopics/digitalproducts.aspx"">digital  products</a> or tangible personal property (books, videos, copies of  games, etc.) as rewards. You don’t have to collect sales tax on items exempt  from sales tax (such as prepackaged food items).</p>
  <p>We recommend you state, when appropriate, that all pledged  amounts include sales tax. Otherwise, we will assume that the pledged amount  does not include sales tax.</p>
  <h3>What sales tax rate do I use?</h3>
  
  <p>The sales tax rate is based upon where the backer receives  the goods or retail services. For example, if a backer in Spokane receives  taxable, tangible personal property then you would use Spokane’s sales tax rate  and location code.</p>
  <h3>The host is charging me a 7 percent fee for their services. Can I deduct  this fee?</h3>
 
  <p>No. You must report the full funding amount without  deducting this fee. This is part of your gross income. The amount kept by the host is a cost of  doing business for the project creator and therefore it cannot be deducted. </p>
  <h3>I am an individual using crowdfunding to raise money for a personal  project. Do I need to register with the Department of Revenue?</h3>
 
  <p>If your annual gross income (donation amount and the host  fee) from crowdfunding is more than $12,000 then you need to register with DOR.  If you are required to collect sales tax on a reward, then you also need to  register with DOR. For more registration information, visit <a href=""/Content/DoingBusiness/RegisterMyBusiness/"">/Content/DoingBusiness/RegisterMyBusiness/</a>.</p>
  <h3>What tax classification should you use with crowdfunding?</h3>
 
  <p>Your Business and Occupation (B&O) tax classification is  based on the rewards you give your backers. You need to figure out the tax on  each donation you receive. The minimum donation amount  at each level is considered to be the value of the item. The amounts above the  minimum donation are considered to be donations and are not subject to tax. Contact  the Department for a ruling if you think a reward should be valued a different  way. </p>
  <p><strong>General B&O Tax classification rules:</strong></p>
  <ul><li>Amounts received for items  with no significant value (such as thank you notes, posting a name)  <em>aren’t</em> subject to  B&O tax.</li>
  </ul><ul><li>Amounts received as  donations (no goods or services provided) <em>aren’t</em> subject to B&O tax or sales tax.</li>
  </ul><ul><li>Amounts received for  providing tangible personal property, digital products and <a href=""/Content/FindTaxesAndRates/RetailSalesTax/RetailServices.aspx"">retail  services</a> in Washington) <em>are</em> subject to B&O tax under the Retailing classification. </li>
  </ul><ul><li>Amounts received for  providing non-retail services <em>are</em> subject to B&O tax under the Service and Other Activities Classification. <strong>Note:</strong> If you are a Washington business,  your service income (regardless of state boundaries) must be reported on your  excise tax return. However, you may be able to apportion some income between  Washington and another state or country. You can do this if you meet at least  one of the <a href=""/Content/FindTaxesAndRates/BAndOTax/EcNexWABus.aspx"">economic  nexus</a> standards (in that other state or country). </li>
  </ul><h3>B&O Tax classification example</h3>
 
  <p>You are a book author. You want to turn one of your books  into a movie so you decide to use crowdfunding to raise money for your project.  You decide to reward your backers in the following ways:</p>
  <ul><li><strong>Tier  1</strong> - Backer donates $1: You write the backer a thank you note.</li>
    <li><strong>Tier  2</strong> - Backer donates $5: You write the backer a thank you note  and list their name online as a supporter.</li>
    <li><strong>Tier  3</strong> - Backer donates $25: You give the backer a signed copy of  your book.</li>
    <li><strong>Tier  4</strong> - Backer donates $100: You invite the backer to a private  screening of your movie.</li>
    <li><strong>Tier  5</strong> - Backer donates $250: You invite the backer to a private  screening of your movie, and to a cast dinner.</li>
    <li><strong>Tier  6</strong> - Backer donates $500: You invite the backer and two guests  to a private screening of your movie, and to a cast dinner. Backer also gets a  cameo movie appearance.</li>
    <li><strong>Tier  7</strong> - Backer donates $1,000: You buy the backer a plane ticket to  the movie opening in Los Angeles, and tickets to attend the opening.</li>
  </ul><p> </p>
  <p>In this example, assume the backer is an individual, not a  business. The B&O tax classification for the donated amount is:</p>
 
  <table><tr><td><strong>Donated amount</strong></td>
      <td><strong>B&O tax classification</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Why?</strong></td>
    </tr><tr><td> Tier 1: $1</td>
      <td>Not taxable</td>
      <td>Insignificant value. More than $1 is considered a donation.</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Tier 2: $5</td>
      <td>Not taxable</td>
      <td>Insignificant value. More than $5 is considered a donation.</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Tier 3: $25</td>
      <td>$25 Retailing</td>
      <td>Sale  of tangible personal property. More than $25 is considered a donation.</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Tier 4: $100</td>
      <td>$100 Service and Other</td>
      <td>Private  screening of a movie is not a retail transaction. More than $100 is considered  a donation.</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Tier 5: $250</td>
      <td>$250 Retailing</td>
      <td>This  transaction is a mix of retail (the dinner is retail if it’s held in Wash.) and  service transactions; the rewards don’t have specific prices. The amount is  subject to Retailing B&O tax unless the dinner value is  less than 10 percent of the whole award’s value. More than $250 is considered a  donation.</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Tier  6: $500</td>
      <td>$500  Retailing </td>
      <td>This  transaction is a mix of retail (the dinner is retail if it’s held in Wash.) and  service transactions; the rewards don’t have specific prices. The amount is  subject to Retailing B&O tax unless the dinner value is less than 10  percent of the whole award’s value. More than $500 is considered a donation.</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Tier  7: $1000</td>
     
          <td><p>$1,000 Service and Other </p></td>
       
      <td>Plane  ticket and movie opening tickets are not retail transactions. More than $,1000  is considered a donation.</td>

  <p>Initiative 1183 requires Washington  State to: </p>
  <ul><li>Close the state liquor stores on May 31, 2012.</li>
    <li>Allow private spirits retailer licensees to sell spirits to the general  public beginning June 1, 2012.  
      
    </li>
  </ul><br /><p>Go to our <a href=""#table"">at-a-glance chart</a> to see:</p>
  <ul><li>The implementation timeline. </li>
    <li>How taxes apply to spirits sales. <br /><br /></li>
  </ul><p><strong>What are spirits?</strong><br />
    Spirits are:</p>
  <ul><li>Any beverage containing alcohol that is obtained by  distillation, except flavored malt beverages as defined under <a href=""http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=66.04.010"" target=""_blank"">RCW 66.04.010(20)</a>. These products have labels that indicate ""proof.""</li>
    <li>Wines exceeding 24 percent alcohol by volume as indicated on the label.</li>
  </ul><br /><p><strong>How do I get a license to sell spirits? </strong><br />
    You can apply for a license through the Business Licensing  Service at <a href=""http://bls.dor.wa.gov/liquor.aspx"">http://bls.dor.wa.gov/liquor.aspx</a>. The Washington Liquor and Cannabis Board  (LCB) approves or denies license applications.  </p>
  <p><br /><strong>What taxes apply to spirits?</strong><br />
    There are two types of spirits taxes: a spirits sales tax  and a spirits liter tax. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Spirits Sales Tax (SST): </strong>This tax is based on the selling price of spirits in their original  package. </p>
    <ul><li>Spirits sales tax rate paid by the general public: 20.5% </li>
      <li>Spirits sales tax rate paid by on-premises retailers such as  restaurants, bars, etc., on their purchases from distributors, distillers, etc.: 13.7% </li>
    </ul><p><br /><strong>Spirits Liter Tax (SLT): </strong>This tax is based on the volume of the spirits being sold in the  original package. </p>
    <ul><li>Spirits liter tax rate paid by the general public:  $3.7708 per liter</li>
      <li>Spirits liter tax rate paid by on-premises retailers such as  restaurants, bars, etc., on their purchases from distributors, distillers, etc.: $2.4408 per liter</li></ul></blockquote>Other taxes also apply. 
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Business & Occupation (B&O)  taxes: </strong> B&O taxes apply to the manufacture and/or  sale of spirits.</p>
      <p><br /><strong>Retail sales tax</strong>: This tax is collected on  drinks containing spirits sold by restaurants, bars or other establishments  that have an on-premises license. </p>
    </blockquote>
  <p> To see when these taxes apply, see the implementation chart below.</p>
  <br /><p><strong>How do I report and pay spirits taxes?</strong><br />
  Businesses that owe spirits taxes to the Department are required to report those taxes on their monthly tax returns using E-file, the Department's online filing system.

  <p><br /><strong>How to calculate spirits taxes</strong><br />
    Use this <a href=""/sites/default/files/documents/forms/Misc/DORSpiritsTaxCalculator.xls"" target=""_blank"">Spirits Tax Calculator (.xls)</a> to determine:</p>
  <ul><li>Your final price including the SST and SLT.</li>
    <li>Your price before SST and SLT are calculated.</li>
  </ul><p><br /><strong>Documenting that the right spirits tax rate was collected</strong><br />
    On-premises licensees pay the lower SST and SLT rates when purchasing spirits. Purchases of spirits by licensees such as: off premises, distributors, spirits manufacturers, or importers are exempt from spirits taxes. </p>
  <p>In both cases, the purchaser must provide the seller documentation to purchase at the lower rate or exempt of spirits taxes. Acceptable documentation  means one of the following:</p>
  <ul><li>A copy of the Business License which shows the type of liquor license(s) the purchaser holds</li>
    <li><a href=""http://bls.dor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/images/BusinessLicenseTearOff.jpg"" target=""_blank"">A copy of the ""tear off"" portion</a> of the Business License</li>
    <li>All of the following data elements:
      <ul><li>Taxpayer name</li>
        <li>Address</li>
        <li>Type of liquor license(s) with license number</li>
        <li>UBI</li>
        <li>Expiration date</li>
      </ul></li>
    <li>A printed copy of the purchaser's business license as listed in the ""business license search"" found online at <a href=""http://bls.dor.wa.gov/LicenseSearch/"" target=""_blank"">licenselookup.wa.gov</a>.</li>
  </ul><p>The seller must keep a copy of the documentation  for audit purposes.</p>
  <p>The Department has created a one page <a href=""/sites/default/files/documents/Pubs/Spirits/SpiritsLicensePurchaseList.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Spirits License Purchase List</a> (pdf). This list provides spirits sellers with the tax rate at which each type of spirits license can purchase.<br /><br /></p>
  <p><strong>Itemizing the Spirits Taxes</strong><br />
    For spirits sold in the original  packaging to the general public and on-premises licenses, the seller must  separately state the spirits taxes. This can be on a price list made available  to customers or on a sales invoice provided to customers.  Advertised prices or shelf prices will be considered <u>not</u> to include the spirits taxes unless they clearly identify the amount  of spirits taxes included in the listed price.  The spirits sales tax and  the spirits liter tax can be combined into one “Spirits Taxes” amount. The  use of the term “tax included” will not suffice for the requirement to itemize  the spirits taxes.</p>
  <p><strong>Sales to Non-Residents</strong><br />
    The nonresident exemption for the  general sales tax <strong>does not apply</strong> to spirits taxes. Nonresidents must pay  the spirits taxes.</p>
